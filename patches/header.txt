Here I'll detail the structure of the header of a cake file:

format: size | description | comments

Main header:
1 | Amount of patches
1 | Firmware version
1 | Higher 4 bits: Console type. Lower 4 bits: Patch type.
1 | Offset to the end of the description string | At this offset we'll place the patch headers
? | Description string + 0 byte

Patch header:
4 | Offset in memory | Where the patch will be copied
4 | Offset in this file
4 | Size of this patch
1 | Options byte | See options.txt
