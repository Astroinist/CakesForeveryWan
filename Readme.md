This is a homebrew for the 3ds that helps with patching the NATIVE\_FIRM, thus allowing for it to do things it wasn't supposed to do.

Building
--------

You need 3 things: Python 2.x or 3.x, devkitARM, and armips.  
Make sure the cross compilers (arm-none-eabi-\*), armips and python3 are in your $PATH.  
If everything's set up, just run make.  


Thanks

* Normmatt for the emuNAND patch.
* Roxas75 for the font and firmlaunchax on MSET (rxTools)
